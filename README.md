# COMP 231 <br/>  Lab 4 - Polling Devices

This lab consists of four subproblems. For each one, you will need to
write a short ARM assembly language program and create a matching Altera
Monitor Program project. You will submit your work with GitHub
Classroom. Your lab submission should consist of four folders named
`part1`, `part2`, etc.

The purpose of this assignment is to gain familiarity with hardware
device control and usage.

# Part 1: General Purpose I/O Devices

The switch, LEDs, key buttons, and seven-segment displays are all
connected to the ARM CPU as **general-purpose I/O** devices (or **GPIO**
devices) through a *parallel port*. So far, we've only used the base
address of each device to read or write data to it. In reality, these
devices consist of multi-word control and data registers, which allow us
to use them in more sophisticated ways. This lab and the next lab will
explore these uses. In general, a GPIO device consists of four registers
as shown in Fig. [1](#fig:gpio)

Each register is 32-bits wide and have the following purposes:

- **Data Register:** This register is used to read data from the device
  (if it is an input device) or write data to the device (if it is an
  output device). This register is located at the base address of the
  device.

- **Direction Register:** This register is used to define the direction
  of transfer for each bit, if it is connected to a bidirectional
  hardware device.

- **Interrupt-mask register:** Used to enable interrupts (if supported)
  on the device.

- **Edge-capture register:** This register indicates that the value in
  the data register has changed. Once set, this will remain set until a
  zero is written to it.

These parallel port registers are *memory mapped*, starting at a *base*
address. The base address is the address of the *data register* of the
parallel port. The addresses of the other registers are 4, 8, or 12
bytes (1, 2, or 3 words) from the base address. We will only be using
the data register for this part.

The usage and legality of each of the parallel GPIO port registers
depends on the device configuration itself. For example, there are only
four keypress buttons on the DE10, and the device is read-only, so the
device is setup as in Fig. [2](#fig:key)

<figure id="fig:key" data-latex-placement="h">
<img src="img/key.png" />
<figcaption>Parallel port connected to the pushbutton keys</figcaption>
</figure>

For this part, you will display a decimal value on the seven-segment
display, which will change when you press a keypress button.

1.  If $KEY_0$ is pressed, you should display a zero on $HEX_0$. If
    $KEY_1$ is pressed, increment and display the updated number. If
    $KEY_2$ is pressed, decrement and display the number. If $KEY_3$ is
    pressed, the display should be blanked (i.e. no number displayed).
    This process should loop indefinitely.

2.  To read a keypress button, you must consult the data register of the
    $KEY$ GPIO port, located at address `0xFF200050`. As shown in
    Fig. [2](#fig:key){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:key"}, you
    will need to check each of the four bits (one for each key) in the
    data register. The bit will be set (1) when the button is pressed
    zero when not pressed. You will need to loop while the button is
    pressed in order to wait until the button is released.

3.  You should copy code from Part 4 of Lab 2 to avoid having to
    re-write the code that displays numbers on seven-segment displays.

4.  Write your program in a file named `part1.s` and create a new Altera
    Monitor Program project for this part.

5.  Compile and test your program to make sure it works correctly.

# Part 2: A simple timer

For this part, you will write an assembly language program that displays
a two-digit decimal counter on the seven-segment displays, $HEX_1$ and
$HEX_0$

1.  The counter should advance approximately every 0.25 seconds. When
    the counter reaches 99, it should reset back to zero.

2.  To wait 0.25 seconds, we will use a *delay loop*. This is an
    inefficient, but simple way to sleep for a specific duration. The
    code to do this is shown below (you can use any register):

                 do_delay: ldr  r7, =200000000 // delay counter
                 sub_loop: subs r7, r7, #1   // subtract one, set status
                           bne sub_loop

3.  The main complication with using the delay loop is that you may miss
    the time when keypress happens. To address this, we will use the
    *edge-capture register* on the GPIO port. When a button is pressed,
    the corresponding bit in the edge-capture register will be set until
    you reset it back to zero.

4.  Create your program in `part2.s` and create a new project file to go
    along with your program.

5.  Compile and test your program to make sure it works correctly.

# Part 3: Hardware Timers

In Part 2, we used a delay loop to wait 0.25 seconds. This is
inefficient because the program loops many, many, times until enough
time has passed. This keeps the CPU at 100% utilization and we can't do
anything other than wait for the time to pass. In this part, we will use
a hardware timer so that we don't have to rely on a delay loop, and we
also get a more accurate timer.

The DE10 has a number of hardware timers. For this part, we will use the *ARM
A9 Private Timer* as shown in Fig. [3](#fig:timer). This timer has four
registers, starting at the address `0xFFFEC600`. Detailed information about
this timer can be found in the *DE10-Standard Computer System with ARM Cortex
A9* document that can be found on Canvas.

</figure>

1.  To use the timer, you first write a value to the *load register*.
    This timer operates at a frequency of 200MHz, so once every clock
    tick, the *counter register* will decrement from the initial load
    value, down to zero.

2.  The timer will only start timing when a 1 has been written to the
    *enable* bit (E) of the *control register*. The timer will stop if a
    zero is written to the enable bit.

3.  When the timer reaches zero, it will set the F bit in the *interrupt
    status register* to 1. This will remain set until a zero is written
    to this bit.

4.  If the *automatic* bit (A) of the control register is set, then the
    load value will be used to reset the timer and start timing again
    automatically.

5.  Create your program in `part3.s` and create a new project file to go
    along with your program.

6.  Compile and test your program to make sure it works correctly.

# Part 4: A Real-time Clock

For the last part, you will write a program that implements a real-time
clock. You should display the time on the four seven-segment displays
($HEX_3 \ldots HEX_0$) in the `SS:DD` format, where `SS` is seconds and
`DD` are hundredths of a second.

1.  Measure time intervals of 0.01 seconds, by polling the A9 Private
    Timer. Every time the timer elapses, update the time counter and
    display it on the seven-segmented displays.

2.  If any $KEY$ button is pressed, you should stop the timer if it's
    running and start it if it is not running. The timer should
    initially start off and will start with a button press.

3.  When the clock reaches `59:99`, it should wrap around to `00:00`

4.  Create your program in `part4.s` and create a new project file to go
    along with your program.

5.  Compile and test your program to make sure it works correctly.

# Submission
